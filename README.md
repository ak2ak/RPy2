# RPy2

The two most popular programming tools when conducting a Data Science project are Python and R. Many of us have to decide which tools should be used, either R or Python. However, rather than treating those two tools as a rival, how about combining the power of both tools? As a data science enthusiast, I am curious if there is any package in Python to enable this beautiful symbiosis. RPy2 is the answer to my curiosity.
